# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
It's useful to do the same action over an array without having to individually invoke a method in each element. This is much faster than doing it indvidually!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I feel like this is a trick question! I have so much more to learn about code blocks and iteration. I know you can do a more simple code block by using || {} but I'm unsure in which case it's better rather than using an entire code block like in the excercises. Probably mostly just to simplify your code? 

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

The self-guided research went well and navigating through ruby docs/google was great. I liked using the approach of googling/finding documentation first, then asking a large language model for some examples to see what would be the most effective or common solution. I got to learn some new methods on the way. I'm beginning to see that memorizing methods really isn't all that important (althought probably more efficient in the future) but understanding what you want you code to do, and researching that effectively will create a solid foundation.
